- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @celdorwow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, ai, and gaming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning/ai and pursuing Degree in both categories
- Coding is my hobby and usually code in Python and LUA. Rarely in JavaScript, Java, or C/C++.
- I am also interested in creating small and medium addons, including generic frameworks.

For major projects in Python, the IDE Editor I found very useful is PyCharm. For LUA, IntelliJ (with EmmyLua) has also been found very useful. While both PyCharm and IntelliJ can be free for opensource projects, the full free alternative is VSCode. Some more full free alternatives are NeoVim (NeoVim-lua), Atom, or the old good Eclipse etc.
