- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @celdorwow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science, Ai, and gaming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and AI and pursuing Degree
- I usually code in Python and LUA. Rarely in JavaScript, Java, and C/C++.
- I am also interested in making addons and framerowks.

For major projects, the IDE Editor I found very useful is PyCharm. For LUA, IntelliJ (with EmmyLua) has also been found very useful. Both idetors can be free for opensource projects.
The full free alternatives are NeoVim (NeoVim-lua), Atom or VSCode (with EmmyLua).
